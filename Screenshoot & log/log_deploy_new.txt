The following "npm" command builds your Node.js/React application for
production in the local "build" directory (i.e. within the
"/var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-node-js-react-app" directory),
correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for
the best performance.
+ npm run build

> my-app@0.1.0 build
> react-scripts build

The following "npm" command runs your Node.js/React application in
development mode and makes the application available for web browsing.
The "npm start" command has a trailing ampersand so that the command runs
as a background process (i.e. asynchronously). Otherwise, this command
can pause running builds of CI/CD applications indefinitely. "npm start"
is followed by another command that retrieves the process ID (PID) value
of the previously run process (i.e. "npm start") and writes this value to
the file ".pidfile".

(This is why you specified the "args -p 3000:3000" parameter when you
created your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile.)

The following command terminates the "npm start" process using its PID
(written to ".pidfile"), all of which were conducted when "deliver.sh"
was executed.
